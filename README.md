## Difficulty Progression:
- Easy: Flags in HTML comments or simple CSS
- Medium: Flags in hidden elements or CSS properties

## ⚠️ Antivirus Warning
**IMPORTANT**: Some antivirus software (including Windows Defender) may flag these files as potentially malicious due to the realistic cybersecurity content and hacking terminology used in the CTF challenges. 

**This is a FALSE POSITIVE** - these are educational HTML/CSS/JavaScript files only.

### Why this happens:
- Files contain simulated exploit code examples
- Hacking-related terminology and command examples
- File names like "exploits.html" trigger heuristic detection

### Solutions:
1. **Add exception**: Whitelist the project folder in your antivirus
2. **Temporary disable**: Disable real-time protection while working on the CTF
3. **Alternative location**: Move files to a different directory
4. **Educational context**: All code is non-functional and for learning purposes only

### Disclaimer:
All exploit code and hacking tools shown are **simulated and non-functional**. This is purely educational content for cybersecurity training and CTF challenges.
